		<h2>The Start and End of the Clone Wars</h2>
		<p>The Clone Wars began at the Battle of Geonosis when Separatist leader Count Dooku captured Jedi Obi Wan Kenobi and attempted to execute him and his rescuers, Padme Amidala and Anakin Skywalker after they discovered a factory that was building a droid army. Tensions had already been growing since the Trade Federation blockade and battle of Naboo, and the Republic discovered a clone army supposedly made under the name of the jedi council. The Clone Wars lasted for 3 years and led to the downfall of the Galactic Republic and Rise of the Galactic Empire under Emperor Palpatine.</p>

		<p>The Clone Wars ended when Darth Sidious, also known as Chancellor Palpatine, ordered his Sith apprentice Darth Vader to assassinate the Separatist Council on Mustafar, guaranteeing Republic victory. The Chancellor blamed the Jedi for conspiring against him, executing Order 66 and wiping out the Jedi, acquiring emergency wartime powers, and declaring himself Emperor.</p>
